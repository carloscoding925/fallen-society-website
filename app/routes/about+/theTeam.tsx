                                    Hello, my name is Carlos Hernandez & I am a senior here at UNR studying Computer Science. My main interests
                                    within the field involve Front-End Development & Enterprise Software Development. You might be thinking, building a
                                    game is very different than these interests, and you'd be correct. My reason for choosing to build a game revolves
                                    around the fact that I feel that contributing to this project will and has
                                    been a great opportunity to learn more about team collaboration, project management, and game development. I am excited to
                                    be contributing to Fallen Society as building a game has always been something I wanted to do, and I hope you all enjoy
                                    playing our game as much as we enjoyed building it!
