      Fallen Society is a post-apocalyptic third-person survival game that propels the player into a perilous island environment booming with mystery. In order to progress, battle relentless hordes of enemies while uncovering the mysteries of the island. Our wave based survival game looks to reinvent the genre of wave-style games by including resource, objective, and health management. A familiar hack and slash system combined with an inventory, item, and  mission system aims to create a fresh but recognizable experience. Built in Unreal Engine 5, Fallen Society implements key features of the engine such as megascans, locomotion, and procedural content generation in order to deliver an immersive and engaging adventure. This document will cover the details, significance, and management of our project.
