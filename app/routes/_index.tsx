            Fallen Society is a fresh take on third person shooter/survival video games built for PC where the player is put up against hordes of post-apocalyptic mutated animals. 
            The main goal of the game is to survive waves of aggressive enemies while simultaneously trying to maintain other key components of the character such as ammunition, 
            inventory, and health management. The game project aims to combine elements from larger game titles like Doom, Call of Duty Zombies, The Last of Us, and other similar 
            titles, creating a unique, immersive experience that plans to focus on high-intensity combat and survival mechanics. The use of a round based system allows the player 
            to traverse through an interactive world with important secrets hidden behind quests. The player will play as an explorer whose curiosity leads them to explore a whole 
            new ecosystem of unexplored islands. As soon as you begin you realize that this journey will be a fight for your life as the islands are inhabited by mutated animals 
            created from an experiment gone wrong. The longer you take the stronger the mutation gets and the lower chance of  survival you have. Work efficiently to complete the 
            quests and this explorer might just have a chance at saving the human race. To create beautiful graphics and establish a great player experience, Fallen Society is being 
            built using the Unreal Engine 5 game engine to take full advantage of modern gaming technology.
